Hello! Here is the code for the basic game character we created in the introduction to Javascript part 2 tutorial. You can find the post at my website [marlenemhangami.com](https://marlenemhangami.com).

You can use this code with the MIT Liscence. If you need any help reach out to me on twitter @marlene_zw, or visit my website for other contact details.
